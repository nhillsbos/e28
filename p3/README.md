## Outline of features
My app is a blog. I have used it to make seven posts, each containing a piece from one chapter. There is a page that displays all posts. The user can click on the post and be taken to an individual page. Said pages allow the user to go back and forth, or return to all posts. The user can also click on a "favorite" button on the individual post page. Favorite post titles are displayed as links on the "favorite posts page." 

## Outside resources
This helped me understand my "previous/next" post links weren't changing the view:
